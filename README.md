# semantic-versioning

## You have to pass in two arguments first is the version number seperated by `-` like `1-2-3` 
## And the other argument is the update type the options for that are `major` `minor` `patch`

## For the help documentations you can use `-help` or `--help` arguments

The script will automatically bump up to the higher version as soon as the `patch` or `minor` version gets greater than 9.
You can change this behaviour by editing the script.

Feel free to use the script
Hope this helps you out.
